                <p>In this section I want to share with you some songs I have played on the violin. I started to play the violin when I was 6 years old because my friend started playing. I played for a while and then I stopped. Then, when I was 14, I started playing the violin again! I have been playing since then.</p>
                <p>I am currently on level 5 of the Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM) for violin. There are 8 levels in total for the violin.</p>

                <!-- Image above taken from: https://shop.rcmusic.com/products/violin-series-complete-set-2021 -->
                <p> I have LOTS of room for improvement on the violin (as you will likely hear from my music below) but I love learning new patterns and techniques. And, although I am technically doing RCM, my favourite things to play are fun pieces that have nothing to do with RCM. I like finding Taylor Swift violin sheet music online and trying to play those songs. I also have a fiddle book filled with jigs, reels, and hornpipes. I love playing these songs especially because I find them really happy and fun.</p>
                <p> So I have included a couple of songs I have played on the violin below. I hope you enjoy!</p>
