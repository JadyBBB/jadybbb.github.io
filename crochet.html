            <h1>My Crochet Pieces</h1>
            <h2>One of my hobbies is crocheting! I really like granny-square based patterns because I think that they are really cute. Some of the things I have made are below!</h2>

                <h3>Granny Squares</h3>
                <p>This is just a collection of granny squares I have been making as I watch TV. I am planning on sewing them all together to make a blanket once I have enough squares.</p>

                <h3>Beanie/Hat</h3>
                <p>This hat was super easy to make. I started by just making a rectangle with the ribbed look. Then I sewed the seams together and the top together to make it a hat. I also used a ball of yarn that alternated colour for a fun look.</p>

                <h3>Socks</h3>
                <p>I made these socks for my brother. These were actually suprisingly easy to make. And it was really fun, too. All you need is one colour of yarn really, but it looks really cute with the two different colours, as you can see below.</p>

                <h3>Coasters</h3>
                <p>These aren't my favourite creation, but if you have left over yarn and just a few minutes you can make these coasters. They are easy and fun.</p>

                <h3>Bookmark</h3>
                <p>I love making bookmarks. They have a starburst design which I really like. They are really easy to make and they serve as good gifts.</p>

                <h3>Sunflower/Granny Square Bag</h3>
                <p>This bag was a longer project, but so satisfying at the end! I eventually want to line the inside with fabric to make it stronger. But this was a really fun project. It did take a while, but it was relatively simple.</p>
