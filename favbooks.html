                <h2>Book #1: <em>All the Light We Cannot See</em></h2>
                <h3>By: Anthony Doerr</h3>
                <p>RATING: &#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;</p>
                <p>I read <em>All the Light We Cannot See</em> at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. This is one of the best books I have <b>EVER</b> read! It takes place during the WWII time period. The story shifts between the viewpoints of a blind girl from France and a soldier from Germany. I don't want to give anything away, so I will leave it at that. But, trust me, this is a really good book.</p>

                <h2>Book #2: <em>The Help</em></h2>
                <h3>By: Kathryn Stockett</h3>
                <p>RATING: &#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;</p>
                <p><em>The Help</em> is written so nicely, in a very character driven manner. You get to know all of the different characters and you start to sympathize with each one. There are also some very powerful lessons in this book. It is based in Jackson, Mississippi and it follows the lives of three amazing women. I love this book so much, it is definitely worth a read!</p>

                <h2>Book #3: <em>The Last Flight</em></h2>
                <h3>By: Julie Clark</h3>
                <p>RATING: &#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;</p>
                <p>Oh my goodness! This is SUCH a good book! I would categorize it as a suspense novel. It is about two women who switch flights and they are both trying to run away from something. I won't say anything else because this book is too good to spoil. If you like a good mystery/suspense novel, read this book!! It will have you up until the wee hours of the morning. And as soon as you are done you will wish you had never read it so that you could experience it all again!</p>

                <h2>Book #4: <em>The Last Thing He Told Me</em></h2>
                <h3>By: Laura Dave</h3>
                <p>RATING: &#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;</p>
                <p>This book made me want to live on a house boat. It is such a good, cozy book. I would say that this book is also a mystery/suspense novel. I absolutely love this book, too. Basically, what happens is a woman's husband disappears and he tells her to protect his daughter (her step-daughter). For the whole book, this woman is trying to find her husband but there are just so many twists and turns that you can't put it down. Hands down, READ THIS BOOK! (Oh, and they live on a house boat &#x1f609;.)</p>

                <h2>Book #4: <em>Confessions of a Shopaholic</em></h2>
                <h3>By: Sophie Kinsella</h3>
                <p>RATING: &#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;&#x2b50;</p>
                <p>This book is an amazing, feel-good, easy read. It is a rom-com type book. Sophie Kinsella is one of the best authors, in my humble opinion. She will make you laugh out loud, feel a little bit anxious, and really happy at the same time. The book follows the protagonist, Becky Bloomwood, who loves to shop. She works for a financial newspaper, ironically. Anyways, she lives with her best friend, Suz, and they have the best time together. She also meets a guy... That is all I will say.</p>
